#wow-item-bot
A bot that screencaps and displays tooltips and thumbnails of World of Warcraft items in an embed.

Currently this bot only supports Windows 10.

This program requires chromedriver.exe to be present in your PATH along with having two extensions installed:
Cookie Notice Blocker - v1.7.0
uBlock Origin - v1.28.4

Please ensure you pack the extensions to create the .crx file, and replace the pathname accordingly in the bot.py file.
These extensions are critical in ensuring the thumbnails and tooltips get accurately screencapped and displayed.
